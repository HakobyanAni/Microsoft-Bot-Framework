<h3> What is a bot?</h3>
<b>Bots</b> provide an experience that feels less like using a computer and more like dealing with a person - or at least an intelligent robot. They can be used to shift simple, repetitive tasks, such as taking a dinner reservation or gathering profile information, on to automated systems that may no longer require direct human intervention. <b>Bots</b> are a lot like modern web applications, living on the internet and use APIs to send and receive messages. Bots can do the same things other types of software can do - read and write files, use databases and APIs, and do the regular computational tasks. What makes bots unique is their use of mechanisms generally reserved for human-to-human communication.</br><p>
<b>Azure Bot Service</b> provides tools to build, test, deploy, and manage intelligent bots all in one place. Through the use of modular and extensible framework provided by the SDK, tools, templates, and AI services developers can create <i>bots that use speech, understand natural language, handle questions and answers, and more.</i></p>
