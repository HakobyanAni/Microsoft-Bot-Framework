<h3> What is a bot?</h3>
<b>Bots</b> provide an experience that feels less like using a computer and more like dealing with a person - or at least an intelligent robot. They can be used to shift simple, repetitive tasks, such as taking a dinner reservation or gathering profile information, on to automated systems that may no longer require direct human intervention.
<b>Bots</b> are a lot like modern web applications, living on the internet and use APIs to send and receive messages.
Bots can do the same things other types of software can do - read and write files, use databases and APIs, and do the regular computational tasks. What makes bots unique is their use of mechanisms generally reserved for human-to-human communication.
